# Reservations

Reservations is a web application designed to allow apartment administration and residents to coordinate use of community amenities.  
Version one:
-Allows apartment admins to register, log in, create new time slots in 2 hour increments, check which units have reserved the use of the pool, and check which time slots are still available.
-Allows apartment residents to register, log in, commit to following recommended guidelines for social distancing, book apartment resources, and check upcoming reservations.

Future versions may include additional features, such as

-Profiles.  Currently only Admin staff can load Admin pages and only Residents can reservate time.  A more elegant solution would be to hide navigation to pages that the user should not be able to access

-Allow additional units to book amenity at the same time (up to X # of reservations)
